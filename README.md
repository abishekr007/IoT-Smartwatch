# IoT-Smartwatch

This project is an IoT smartwatch built on ESP8266 SOC. It works by connecting with NTP server through Wi-Fi to get date and time. It updates us about the current weather based on our location with the help of Yahoo Weather API. It also has the ability to control two IoT devices from anywhere in the world. The first prototype was developed on a breadboard. Later a PCB was custom designed to make this project wearable. The PCB consists of ESP8266 SOC, 0.96 inch OLED Display, 3 push buttons, a slide switch, a charger circuit and a micro-USB port.
